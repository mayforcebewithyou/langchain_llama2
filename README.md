Here is a sample README file for the Llama chatbot Streamlit app code:

# Llama Chatbot Web App

This is a simple web application to interact with the Llama-2 conversational AI model from Anthropic using Streamlit and the Llama C++ library.

## Setup

The following dependencies are required:

- Streamlit
- Llama C++
- Quantized Llama model file

Install requirements:

```
pip install streamlit llama-cpp
```

Download the quantized model into the models directory:

```
llama-index get models --platform cpu
```

## Usage 

Run the app:

```
streamlit run main_v3.py
```

This will start the Streamlit web server and open the chatbot UI.

Ask questions in the input box and click enter to see Llama's response.

## Model

This app uses the 7B parameter quantized Llama-2 model loaded from the `.bin` file. The model provides conversational responses based on the input question and context.

The model can be changed by updating `llm_model()` to load a different quantized model file.

## Code

`main_v3.py` - Main Streamlit Python code loading the model and handling the UI.

`llm_model()` - Function to load the quantized Llama model.

The LLama C++ library is used to load and run the model. Responses are decoded to text for display.
